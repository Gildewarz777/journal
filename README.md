## Logs

- 20/02/2020: Started learning Scala, focus on OOP -> the 4 pillars: Abstraction (show only some attributes of a class), Encapsulation (wrap methors and data into a class), Inheritance (when a class acquire the properties and behavior of another class), Polymorphism (redefine methods from a class)
- 19/02/2020: Worked on coding interview questions. First Recurring Character problem, algorithmic problems involving hashset and hash tables, best algorithm for convex-hull problem. Read about MySQL vs Postgres -> Postgres hadles concurrency better, and supports a number of advanced data types not available in MySQL, but in some cases MySQL has better performances.
- 18/02/2020: Finished application for Soundcloud, read article on shorter reindexing time for elasticsearch clusters on the Soundcloud tech blog
- 17/02/2020: Finished online resume, lecture on Redis and its advantages -> Redis is a in-memory key-value database. Very fast and flexible, better used for non-structured data for quick lookups. Best way is to use them together, redis for cache and MySQL for storing application data.
