## Logs

- **26/03/2020**: Back from vacations! Preparing interview questions on Docker.
- **22/02/2020**: Big O complexity.
- **21/02/2020**: Reading [Cracking the coding interview](https://github.com/alxerg/Books-1/blob/master/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%2C%206th%20Edition%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf) -> Read about the motivations and objectives of the interviewers and the interview format. Studied [the 4 paradigms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgVVZMfLjEI) (OOP, Functional, Logic and Procedural).
- **20/02/2020**: Started learning [Scala](https://www.scala-exercises.org/), focus on OOP -> the 4 pillars: Abstraction (show only some attributes of a class), Encapsulation (wrap methors and data into a class), Inheritance (when a class acquire the properties and behavior of another class), Polymorphism (redefine methods from a class).
- **19/02/2020**: Worked on coding interview questions. First Recurring Character problem, algorithmic problems involving hashset and hash tables, best algorithm for convex-hull problem. Read about MySQL vs Postgres -> Postgres hadles concurrency better, and supports a number of advanced data types not available in MySQL, but in some cases MySQL has better performances.
- **18/02/2020**: Finished application for Soundcloud, read article on shorter reindexing time for elasticsearch clusters on the Soundcloud tech blog.
- **17/02/2020**: Finished online resume, lecture on Redis and its advantages -> Redis is a in-memory key-value database. Very fast and flexible, better used for non-structured data for quick lookups. Best way is to use them together, redis for cache and MySQL for storing application data.
